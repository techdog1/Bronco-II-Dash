# Bronco-II-Dash
Digital Dash for Ford Bronco II and Ranger using Microsquirt and TunerStudio.
Current work in progress for Bronco II turbo dash.
Have added custom channels for oil pressure and fuel.
Having trouble with the fuel gauge jumping around when the fuel level moves during operation.
Need to buffer the rate of change fuel level is sampled.
Switched to dual round 4 inch led displays that fit in the stock location.
